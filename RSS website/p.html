                         <U><b><h3>Ideology of RSS</h3></b></U>
                         <p>The initial impetus was to provide character training through Hindu discipline and to unite the Hindu community to form a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation). The organisation promotes the ideals of upholding Indian culture and the values of a civil society and spreads the ideology of Hindutva, to "strengthen" the Hindu community.It drew initial inspiration from European right-wing groups during World War II. Gradually, RSS grew into a prominent Hindu nationalist umbrella organisation, spawning several affiliated organisations that established numerous schools, charities, and clubs to spread its ideological beliefs.</p><br>
                        <U> <h3>How Can be a member of RSS</h3></U>
                        <p>RSS does not have any formal membership. According to the official website, men and boys can become members by joining the nearest shakha, which is the basic unit.</p>
